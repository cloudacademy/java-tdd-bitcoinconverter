## Background
The following repo contains Java JDK11 source code developed using TDD (Test Driven Development) practices. The example codebase demonstrates the use of the following tools related to performing TDD:

* [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) - a unit testing framework, used to implement unit tests
* [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) - a mocking library, used to create mocks for external dependencies
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - used to provide build and test project automation and management
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - used to provide CICD features for automated building and testing
* [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) - used to provide unit test code coverage reports
